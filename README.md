## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate design ensures seamless data entry.

- **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Users input demographic information, health indicators (e.g., jaundice), family history of ASD, and behavioral assessments through structured questionnaires.

- **Behavioral Questionnaire**: Evaluates key developmental behaviors, such as eye contact and social interaction, to provide a holistic view of the child's progress.

- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Uses a Naive Bayes model trained on historical data to analyze inputs and predict the likelihood of ASD, offering immediate feedback on results.

- **Clear Results and Insights**: Displays the predicted likelihood of autism along with probability scores to aid interpretation.

- **Error Handling**: Ensures all required fields are completed accurately, providing users with informative prompts for corrections.

- **Privacy and Security**: Protects user data with a focus on privacy, ensuring no personal information is stored beyond the prediction process.

- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with various devices for a consistent experience on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Educational Resources**: Offers links to valuable information about autism signs and the importance of early detection.

**Conclusion**: The Toddler Autism Prediction App is a powerful tool for early autism detection, empowering caregivers to gain insights into their child's developmental health while promoting timely intervention and awareness.
